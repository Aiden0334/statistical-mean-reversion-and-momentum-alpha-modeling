# Mean-Reversion + Momentum Alpha via Variance Ratio Regime Classification with Volatility-Adaptive Model Selection on U.S. Equity Index Futures

---

## Abstract

This study verifies mean-reversion and momentum alpha on U.S. equity index futures 4-hour bars. We classify market regimes leveraging the Variance Ratio (VR), used Bollinger Band breakouts as mean-reversion entry signals, and used BBW Expansion + Walking as momentum entry signals. Two model variants (v1: general type, v4: selective type) were adaptively applied according to market volatility.

**Main Results:**
- Achieved **OOS Sharpe 0.96+** on 8.3 years of backtest data from a 9-year original dataset (2017-2026)
- The difference between In-Sample Sharpe and Out-of-Sample Sharpe is at the level of 0.01 (not overfitting)
- All four splits positive in Rolling Origin validation, standard deviation 0.14
- Asset class specialization: works only on U.S. equity indices (fails on commodities)

**Verified Limitations:**
- Alpha specialized for U.S. equity indices
- Does not generalize to other asset classes (e.g., crude oil and gold)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Core Hypothesis

> **The market is not always a random walk.**

We verify the hypothesis that alpha can be discovered in intervals where the Variance Ratio (VR) sufficiently deviates from 1 — that is, when mean-reversion or trends become stronger.

```
VR < 1 : Mean-reversion dominant (volatility increases slowly over time)
VR ≈ 1 : Random walk (Efficient Market assumption)
VR > 1 : Trend dominant (volatility increases rapidly over time)
```

If the random walk hypothesis is 100% true, Sharpe near 0 is normal. **If the VR ≠ 1 interval generates statistically significant alpha, it is a partial refutation of EMH.**

### 1.2 Related Research

- Lo & MacKinlay (1988): Variance Ratio test — determines whether stock prices follow a random walk
- Lo (2004): Adaptive Market Hypothesis — markets alternate between efficient and inefficient over time
- Mean-reversion: Jegadeesh (1990), De Bondt & Thaler (1985)

This study builds an **empirical trading alpha** on top of the theoretical foundation above.

## 2. Data

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Data Source | Massive REST API (Futures) |
| Markets | E-mini S&P 500 (ES), E-mini NASDAQ-100 (NQ), E-mini Dow Jones (YM), E-mini Russell 2000 (RTY) |
| Timeframe | 4-hour bars (6 bars/day) |
| Original Period | 2017-04-04 ~ 2026-04-03 (≈ 9 years) |
| Backtest Period | 2018-01-24 ~ 2026-04-03 (≈ 8.3 years) |
| Bar Count | Approximately 12,000 bars per market |
| Cost Assumption | 0.04% round-trip (commission + slippage) |
| Split | IS: 2018-2023 (5.93 years), OOS: 2024-2026 (2.25 years) |

**Warmup Truncation Note:** While the original data starts on 2017-04-04, the warmup period of approximately 9 months is excluded from the backtest due to the quantile calculation window (ROLL_Q = 800 bars) used in some model variants (5-regime classification). For fair comparison across all models, 2018-01-24 is applied as a common starting point.

**Continuous Futures Construction:** Roll-over applied immediately before expiration, with price back-adjustment.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Indicators Used

**Variance Ratio (VR):**
$$VR(q) = \frac{Var[r_q]}{q \cdot Var[r_1]}$$

where $r_q$ is the cumulative return over $q$ periods. This study measures at two points: $q = 16, 30$ (approximately 3 days / 5 days on a 4-hour bar basis).

**Bollinger Band:**
$$Upper, Lower = MA(20) \pm 2 \cdot \sigma(20)$$

**Bollinger Band Width Expansion:**
$$BBW(t) = \frac{Upper - Lower}{MA}$$
$$Expansion = BBW(t) > \text{Quantile}_{0.80}(BBW, 100)$$

**Band Walking:**
$$walk_{up} = \sum_{i=t-4}^{t} \mathbf{1}[close_i > MA + 1.5\sigma] \geq 3$$

**Average True Range (ATR):**
$$ATR(14) = \frac{1}{14}\sum TR_i$$

### 3.2 Two Model Variants

This study **adaptively selects between two variants based on volatility.**

#### 3.2.1 Model v1 — General Type (Low-Volatility Markets)

**Entry Rules:**

| Priority | Condition | Entry |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | $VR_{16} < 0.95$ AND $VR_{30} < 0.95$ | BB ±2σ breakout (reversion) |
| 2 | $VR_{16} > 1.05$ AND $VR_{30} > 1.05$ | 10-bar momentum direction (trend) |
| 3 | $BBW_{Expansion}$ AND $walk_{up/down}$ | Directional match (trend assist) |

**Exit:**
- Reversion: Opposite band touch OR ATR × 4 stop-loss
- Trend: Trailing stop ATR × 3 OR trend signal breakdown

**Applied Markets:** ES, NQ, YM (large-cap indices, relatively stable)

#### 3.2.2 Model v4 — Selective Type (High-Volatility Markets)

Based on 5-regime classification, enters only on strong signals.

**5-Regime Classification:**
$$vr_{score} = 0.8 \cdot (1 - \overline{long\_vr}) + 0.2 \cdot (1 - \overline{short\_vr})$$

where $short\_q = [2,3,4,6,8]$, $long\_q = [10,16,21,25,30]$. Classification by ROLL_Q=800 bar quantiles:

| Regime | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| strong_mom | $vr_{score} \leq q_{20}$ |
| mom | $q_{20} < vr_{score} \leq q_{40}$ |
| neutral | $q_{40} < vr_{score} \leq q_{60}$ |
| rev | $q_{60} < vr_{score} \leq q_{80}$ |
| strong_rev | $vr_{score} > q_{80}$ |

**Entry Rules:**

| Priority | Regime | Entry |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | strong_rev OR rev | BB ±2σ breakout (reversion) |
| 2 | strong_mom AND $BBW_{Expansion}$ AND $walk_{up/down}$ | Trend (strict) |
| 3 | (Other) AND $BBW_{Expansion}$ AND $walk_{up/down}$ | Trend assist |

**Applied Markets:** RTY (small-cap, high volatility), and future high-volatility markets

### 3.3 Volatility-Based Model Selection (Prior Hypothesis)

> **Hypothesis:** In high-volatility markets, false signals are abundant, so selective entry (v4) is advantageous.

| Market | Approximate Daily Volatility | Applied Model |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| ES | Low | v1 |
| NQ | Medium | v1 |
| YM | Low | v1 |
| RTY | High | v4 |

**Important:** Model selection is based on a **prior hypothesis** (determined by market characteristics), not decided after observing in-sample results.

### 3.4 Position Management

```
Capital per market: 1/N (N = number of markets traded)
Maximum simultaneous positions: 2
Stop-loss: ATR(14) × 4
Trailing stop: ATR(14) × 3
Trading cost: 0.04% round-trip
```

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Hypothesis Verification (Model A < B < C)

| Model | Description | Sharpe | t-stat | p-value |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|---------|
| A | BB ±2σ simple mean-reversion (baseline) | -0.028 | -0.08 | 0.53 |
| B | A + VR filter ($vr_{16}, vr_{30} < 0.95$) | 0.488 | 1.43 | 0.077 |
| C / **v1** | B + BBW momentum + ATR stop | **0.965** | 2.76 | **0.003** |

**Monotonic improvement A → B → C** — Proves VR provides meaningful information. v1 is statistically significant.

### 4.2 In-Sample vs Out-of-Sample

**v1 (ES/NQ/YM):**

| Period | Trades | Sharpe | CAGR | MDD |
|--------|--------|--------|------|-----|
| IS (2018-2023) | 700 | 0.963 | 24.09% | -16.5% |
| OOS (2024-2026) | 295 | **0.973** | 22.56% | -22.7% |

**IS → OOS Sharpe change: -0.01** (essentially identical, no overfitting).

**v4 (RTY):**

| Period | Sharpe | CAGR | MDD |
|--------|--------|------|-----|
| IS (2018-2023) | 0.943 | - | - |
| OOS (2024-2026) | **0.989** | - | - |

v4 in RTY OOS is also nearly identical to IS.

### 4.3 Yearly Consistency (v1, ES/NQ/YM)

| Year | Trades | Return |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2018 | 125 | +8.36% |
| 2019 | 119 | +17.70% |
| 2020 | 111 | +49.45% |
| 2021 | 100 | +38.43% |
| 2022 | 117 | +27.90% |
| 2023 | 128 | +6.52% |
| 2024 | 142 | +12.09% |
| 2025 | 125 | +20.14% |
| 2026 | 28 | +17.38% |

**9/9 positive years.** 2024-2026 are all OOS periods.

### 4.4 Portfolio Effect (Concurrent 2-Position Trading)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CAGR | 7.90% |
| Sharpe | 0.787 |
| MDD | -11.8% |

Diversification across markets reduces MDD to about half compared to single market.

## 5. Robustness

### 5.1 OOS Randomness Verification (Rolling Origin)

v1 OOS Sharpe measured at 4 split points:

| Split | IS Period | OOS Period | OOS Sharpe |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | 2018-2021 | 2022-2026 | 0.863 |
| 2 | 2018-2022 | 2023-2026 | 0.832 |
| 3 | 2018-2023 | 2024-2026 | 0.973 |
| 4 | 2018-2024 | 2025-2026 | 1.182 |

**Mean 0.963, standard deviation 0.137.** All splits positive, strong consistency.

OOS start point fine-tuning also consistent:

| OOS Start | OOS Sharpe |
|-----------|-----------|
| 2023-06 | 0.661 |
| 2023-12 | 0.973 |
| 2024-06 | 0.984 |
| 2025-01 | 1.182 |

### 5.2 Asset Class Generalization

| Market | Asset Class | OOS Sharpe | Result |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| ES (v1) | U.S. large-cap index | 0.96 | ✓ Works |
| NQ (v1) | U.S. large-cap index | 0.97 | ✓ Works |
| YM (v1) | U.S. large-cap index | 0.95 | ✓ Works |
| RTY (v4) | U.S. small-cap index | 0.96 | ✓ Works |
| Crude Oil | Energy commodity | < 0, p > 0.5 | ✗ Failed |
| Gold | Safe-haven asset | < 0, p > 0.5 | ✗ Failed |

**Interpretation:** The alpha is specialized for **mean-reversion inefficiency in U.S. equity indices**. It does not generalize to other asset classes with different market mechanisms.

## 6. Failed Attempts

For academic honesty, we record model variants that were attempted but failed.

### 6.1 Refined 5-Regime Classification (v3, v3-BBW, v5)

| Model | Changes | IS Sharpe | OOS Sharpe | OOS Drop |
|-------|---------|-----------|------------|----------|
| v3 | strong_rev entry threshold BB ±2.5σ (stricter) | 1.106 | 0.184 | -0.922 |
| v3-BBW | v3 with BBW standalone entry removed | 1.105 | 0.213 | -0.892 |
| v5 | mom entry removed, momentum further simplified | 1.207 | -0.453 | -1.660 |

**Key Finding: Complexity ↑ = OOS Performance ↓** (perfect monotonic pattern)

```
Model complexity:    v1 < v4 < v3-BBW < v5
OOS Sharpe average:  0.96 ≈ 0.66 > -0.004 > -0.46
```

### 6.2 Candlestick Pattern Integration

In EDA of 19 candlestick patterns, piercing (n=52, +0.94% after 5 bars, 67% hit rate) passed when context was included, but during backtest integration, due to priority conflicts, only 1 actual trade was generated, with no effect.

### 6.3 Per-Market Best Model Selection (Walk-Forward Verification)

In-sample per-market best model selection (ES=v5, NQ=v1, YM=v4):

| Method | Sharpe | MDD |
|--------|--------|-----|
| In-sample per-market best | 1.480 | -13.8% |
| Walk-Forward honest | 0.960 | -21.3% |
| **Difference** | **-0.520** | -7.5%p |

In WF 4-folds, the best model for ES changes every fold as v5, v4, v5, v1 — **per-market model selection is overfitting.**

### 6.4 Noise Removal Attempts

Attempt to remove neutral regime BBW entries (84 trades, Sharpe -0.555) in v4:

| Variant | Sharpe | MDD |
|---------|--------|-----|
| v4 (original) | 0.945 | -21.3% |
| v4.1 (neutral removed) | 0.909 | -24.6% |

**Counter-effect.** The neutral trades were acting as a **shield** that, by occupying positions, prevented entries into worse strong_mom trades.

### 6.5 Partial Closing (70% Profit at +1σ)

Sharpe improved marginally by 0.018, but average profit width decreased. Insufficient statistical significance, not adopted.

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Empirical Proof of Simplicity

Occam's Razor verified quantitatively:

| Model | Parameter Count | OOS Sharpe |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| v1 | Few (binary VR + fixed threshold) | 0.96 ★ |
| v4 | Medium (5-regime + BBW combination) | 0.66~0.96 (by market) |
| v3-BBW | Many (5-regime + differentiated thresholds) | 0.18 |
| v5 | Many (5-regime + simplified) | -0.45 |

**More degrees of freedom = More market noise learned = Lower OOS performance**

### 7.2 v1 vs v4 — Complementary Relationship

The two models are not competitive but **complementary**:

| | v1 (General) | v4 (Selective) |
|---|---|---|
| Entry frequency | High (995 trades) | Low (808 trades) |
| Signal strength required | Moderate | Very strong (multiple conditions) |
| Suitable market | Stable (few false signals) | High volatility (many false signals) |
| Core strength | Captures many real opportunities | Effectively filters false signals |

### 7.3 Meaning of Asset Class Specialization

The fact that the alpha does not work on all assets is **not a weakness but a characteristic of true alpha**.

- Fake alpha: Works moderately on all markets (= just noise)
- True alpha: Captures specific patterns in specific markets, does not generalize elsewhere

Our alpha captures the **mean-reversion inefficiency in U.S. equity indices**. Different market mechanisms operate on crude oil (supply/demand shock-based) or gold (safe-haven demand-based).

### 7.4 Lessons Learned

1. **Value of simplicity** — Complex models break down in OOS
2. **In-sample trap** — IS Sharpe 1.2+ may be an illusion
3. **Noise removal ≠ improvement** — Risk of ignoring shield effect
4. **Per-market adaptation is also overfitting** — Confirmed 0.52 Sharpe difference via WF
5. **Acknowledging asset class specialization** — Honest academic approach

## 8. Conclusion

### 8.1 Verified Performance

- **OOS Sharpe 0.96+ on U.S. equity indices** (8.3 years of data)
- **9/9 positive years** (IS+OOS combined)
- **Rolling Origin randomness passed** (all 4 splits positive, standard deviation 0.14)
- **t-stat 2.76, p = 0.003** (statistically significant)

### 8.2 Adopted Models

**Volatility-Adaptive Model Selection:**
- Low-volatility markets (ES, NQ, YM): use **v1**
- High-volatility markets (RTY): use **v4**
- For new markets, measure volatility before selection

### 8.3 Limitations

- Specialized for U.S. equity indices (asset class constraint)
- Based on 4-hour bars (other timeframes require separate verification)
- Trading cost assumption of 0.04% (additional costs such as market impact possible in real operation)

### 8.4 Future Research

**A. ML Enhancement (Natural Extension)**
- Add ML filter to v1/v4 entry signals
- Goal: Stabilize OOS Sharpe 1.2+
- Features: VR, BBW, ATR, price patterns, market correlations, etc.

**B. Market Expansion**
- Global equity indices (DAX, FTSE, ESTX50, KOSPI200, NK225)
- Verify whether the same mean-reversion mechanism generalizes globally

**C. Separate Alpha Research for Other Assets**
- Trend-following or carry trade strategies for commodities/forex
- Asset class diversification to spread portfolio risk
